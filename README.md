# gdsc_i2it

This project is a part of the COMPOSE CAMP 2022 app submission.
COMPOSE CAMP was held at International Institute Of Information Technology,Pune by GDSC (Google Developer Student Club) I2IT.
I was a part of the COMPOSE APP SUBMISSION TEAM, and contributed the ROADMAPS screen.
We have built an app for student community of our college that is GDSC I²IT students club which would help students know about events of GDSC and get resources to learn different technologies.
